# Prefab App Design
## Requirements
1. Create Prefabs
    1. Load in an existing prefab
    2. Load in an existing text file (such as Zorbus txt files)
    3. Start from scratch
2. Edit Prefabs
    1. Add points of interests
        1. Source Points
        2. Entities
    2. Draw tiles
        1. Mouse drawing onto map
        2. Change tile
        3. *would be nice* Different sizes and shapes for brush size
    3. Add tags
        1. Pull tags from a list to ensure consistency
        2. Add new tags to list
3. Export Prefabs
    1. Save to a json
        1. Saved to a folder for the game
        2. Enter a name
    2. **LAST** Game Compability
        1. Make the json readable and usable by the game
    3. Export map with pickle

## Issues
* Should we move this to a seperate project?
