# Ideas

## :pen:Project Management
- Trello is probably overkill and switching to a format like this may be worth the switch after finishing [Version 0.1]

## Tilesets
- Different tilesets for different environment
    1. Overworld
    2. Caves
    3. ???
- Really need to pick and stick with a tileset which should have:
    1. Small (8x8 or 16x16)
    2. Some graphics (player, frequent *objects*)
    3. Good with 1 color with some shading
    4. Utilize only lower/upper case to make room for sprites
    5. CP437 font page
- Ablity to switch tilesets on demand
    1. Support most DF fonts and make menu setting that lets you switch tilesets
